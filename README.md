# What is this ?

In view of the upcoming "The Frontend Developer Career Path" class that will be given for free, Scrimba is organising a ten-day JS challenge where we get, by email, a different JS challenge every day for ten days.

# JS challenges as of now :
## Challenge 1 : Add
This was about creating a function that takes in two parameters and then returns their sum. After that, we must create a function that can take in any number of parameters and then return their sum.

## Challenge 2 : All the Longest Strings

## Challenge 3 : Alternating Sums

## Challenge 4 : Array Replace
