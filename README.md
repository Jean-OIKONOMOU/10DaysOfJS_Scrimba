# What is this ?

In view of the upcoming "The Frontend Developer Career Path" class that will be given for free, Scrimba is organising a ten-day JS challenge where we get, by email, a different JS challenge every day for ten days.

# JS challenges as of now :
## Challenge 1 : Add
This was about creating a function that takes in two parameters and then returns their sum. After that, we must create a function that can take in any number of parameters and then return their sum.

## Challenge 2 : All the Longest Strings
Create a way to make an array of the longest strings from another given array of strings.

## Challenge 3 : Alternating Sums
Given an array of integers, create a way to show the sums of the numbers that are in the odd positions of that given array, and the sum of the numbers that are in the even positions of that given array.

## Challenge 4 : Array Replace
Given an array of integers, a specific integer to find in that array, and another random integer, replace the value of the integer you found in the array with the value of the random integer you've been given.

## Challenge 5 : Case Insensitive Palindrome
Using a combination of reverse(), slipt(), and join() declare if a string composed of less than 13 letters is a palindrome (more fun to do without reverse() I think).

## Challenge 6 : Enclose in Brackets
Given a string, enclose it in brackets.

## Challenge 7 : Factorial
Given a whole integer, return its factorial.

## Challenge 8 : First Digit
Given a string, return the first digit encoutered while parsing the string using split() and includes()

## Challenge 9 : Largest Number
Given a digit, return the largest number of size equal to the digit entered as argument. For example, if the digit equals 2 then the returned largest number will be equal to 99. If the digit equals 5 then the returned largest number will be equal to 99999. Use
